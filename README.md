PyQT5 tutorial
==============

A tutorial project to teach myself PyQT5.

- first.py - a sort of Hello World. Has a button and an entry field.

includes a setup.py for use with cx_freeze. I had to install cx_freeze from: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#cx_freeze
because of a bug in the official version. 

To create an installable package:

    python setup.py bdist_msi
